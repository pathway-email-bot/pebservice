## Scenario Quality

- [ ] **Review each scenario for student success** — scenarios are currently theoretical and may set students up to fail. Go through each scenario and identify gaps, e.g. a scenario references "a report you sent" but the student never actually sent one and has no context. Consider generating simple supporting artifacts (e.g. a 3-line report) in the scenario instructions so students have concrete material to work with.
