Your operations lead Ravi Shah sent you a long message describing a multi-step process for handling customer requests, but a few parts are unclear to you. Reply to Ravi's email. Thank him for the instructions, briefly summarize what you understood, and ask 2–3 clear questions about the parts you do not understand. Use simple English and show that you want to learn and avoid mistakes.",

  "starter_email_body": "Hi {student_name},\n\nWelcome to the team! I wanted to walk you through our process for handling incoming customer requests so you can start picking these up next week.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. When a new request comes in through the portal, first check if the customer already has an open ticket. If they do, merge the new request into the existing ticket. If they don't, create a new ticket and assign it a priority level (P1 through P4) based on the impact matrix in the shared drive.\n\n2. For P1 and P2 tickets, escalate immediately to the on-call engineer using the #urgent-support Slack channel. For P3 and P4, add them to the weekly triage queue. Note that P2 tickets also need to be logged in the compliance tracker if they involve billing or account access.\n\n3. After the engineer responds, send the customer an update within 2 business hours. Use the response template from the Templates folder, but make sure to personalize the greeting and reference their specific issue. If the engineer hasn't responded within 4 hours, ping them again and CC me.\n\n4. Once the customer confirms resolution, close the ticket and tag it with the appropriate category from the dropdown menu. Then update the weekly metrics spreadsheet with the resolution time. If the ticket took longer than our SLA (24 hours for P1/P2, 72 hours for P3/P4), flag it in the SLA exceptions column.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. I'd rather you ask now than run into issues later!\n\nBest,\nRavi",
