Hi Daniel,

I noticed an error in the Q1 Regional Sales Summary I sent

regional total is also affected.

I have attached an updated version with the correction.

Sorry for the mistake. Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: Correction to Q1 Regional Sales Summary — Midwest March Revenue
```
Dear Daniel,

I am writing to let you know about a data entry error I
discovered in the "Q1 Regional Sales Summary" spreadsheet
I sent you yesterday.

Here is exactly what changed:
- Row: Midwest region
- Column: March revenue
- Incorrect value: $12,400
- Correct value: $14,200
- Impact: The Midwest region total has been updated
  accordingly (increased by $1,800).

I have attached the corrected version of the file. The only
change is in the cell and total described above — all other
data remains the same.

I sincerely apologize for the oversight. I am adding a
double-check step to my process to make sure data is
verified before submission going forward. Accuracy is very
important to me, and I want to make sure you can rely on
the reports I send.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need
anything else.

Best regards,

```
Dear Emily,

Thank you again for your help with the onboarding process.
I wanted to follow up on our conversation from last week
regarding the documents for our new hire who starts on
March 3rd.

I still need the following three items to complete the
onboarding report:

1. Signed I-9 Employment Verification Form
2. Direct Deposit Authorization Form
3. Emergency Contact Information Sheet

My manager needs the completed report by February 28th,
so it would be very helpful if you could send these
documents by February 25th. This will give me enough time
to compile everything.

If any of the documents are not ready yet, could you kindly
let me know when I should expect them? I am happy to work
around your schedule.

Thank you so much for your time and support. I know you
have a lot on your plate, and I really appreciate it.

Kind regards,
